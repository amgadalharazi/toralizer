In this code, we’ve implemented SOCKS 4, a protocol that relays TCP sessions through a firewall, enabling transparent access for applications across the firewall. SOCKS 4 is independent of application protocols, making it versatile for various services like Telnet, FTP, WHOIS, HTTP, and more. It allows access control at the start of each session and then efficiently relays data between the client and server with minimal overhead. Since SOCKS doesn’t need to understand the application protocol, it can easily accommodate encrypted applications. For more details, visit the official protocol documentation [here](https://www.openssh.com/txt/socks4.protocol).

Additionally, this project utilizes Hooking Shared Libraries, which allows for modifying program behavior at runtime. More information can be found [here](https://rjordaney.is/lectures/hooking_shared_lib/).
